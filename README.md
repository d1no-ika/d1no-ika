hiiii!! okay, i dunno how github works so bear with me.......

hi everypony! im dino i like to lurk on the town of ponies.. well, not lurk, but i love seeing everyones creative and beautiful avatars!!

im super friendly yet super awkward and nervous, so pls be patient with me,, i love to hang out and chat, so interactions + cuddles and hugs are def ok and encouraged!! im lowkey a lonely chud so any interactions or conversations really make me happy :]] i am 18 so keep that in mind!

im normally making another pony/offtab, so whisper to get my attention ^^ also also if we sit for a bit together its ok to add me as a friend! no need to ask :DD

my strawpage has more info abt me, but im currently fixated on umamusume and pokemon! i also have outfits based on splatoon/coroika and bfdi

umamusume fans pls interact (not forcing.. obviously ^^)!! very fixated on the game at the moment,, my current favs are shinko windy and mayano top gun!
